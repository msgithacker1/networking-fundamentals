#Network Communication is reliant on 3 things:
1. MAC Addresses: 
2. IP Addresses:  
3. Ports


#MAC Addresses:
- 48-bit, 6 pairs of hexadecimals joined together with a colon.
- First 24-bits identify the manufacturer who created the NIC that the MAC is assigned to (the identifier). Second set of 24-bits identify the device itself.
- Data is sent as frames between devices on a LAN using MAC addresses and switch forwarding.
- Data is sent as frames from devices to a router using MAC addresses. A router would strip the data of the MAC and find the destination IP, repackage with a new data frame containing source MAC (its MAC) and destination MAC (the MAC of the router it's going to) as a hop. The new router would strip the data of the MAC, find the IP of the destination and repackage with a new source and destination MAC and direct it to the correct device on the network (how data is sent using MAC across different networks)

#IP Addresses:
- Assigned to every network-connected device that relies on Internet Protocol
- Used by routers to direct data to other routers
- Can be static or dynamic
- IPV4 is 32-bit (E.g., 192.168.0.1 has 4 octets - each of the 4 parts - which are each represented by 8-bit binary numbers so overall 32-bits)
- IPV4 addresses starting with "192.168" and other classes of private IPs are private IPs and not going to be usable on a public outer network, like the Internet
- IPV6 is 128-bit, designed due to shortage of available IPs
- IP addresses for local use (not routable on the Internet) will often be assigned from RFC 1918 IPs on a LAN/private network

= ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is often used to map MAC addresses to known IP addresses to help devices send data frames to the correct recipient. The sender would use ARP to find the MAC of the destination IP and send (with the switch seamlessly forwarding the data frame to the recipient)

#Ports:
- Ports are just a way to access a service on a machine over the Internet
- Different services on a device are assigned unique ports
- Often used for interacting with a device for multiple services to sort network traffic for different reasons. Applications/services running on different ports would "listen" and respond to requests e.g., a webpage request 
- Work with TCP and UDP at the Transport Layer of the OSI model
- Well-Known Ports are used commonly and universally, managed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). E.g., 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS, 20/21 for FTP
- Registered Ports are registered with the IANA but not as well monitored
- Dynamic/Private Ports are used for temporary services


If someone wanted to access a specific service on a specific port on a different machine, it would use a 3-way TCP handshake to establish a connection.

It would send a SYN packet requesting connection to that port. Receive a SYN-ACK back (if the port is open and accepting connections) and then send a final ACK to confirm connection.

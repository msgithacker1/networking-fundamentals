#Network Communication is reliant on 3 things:
1. MAC Addresses: 
2. IP Addresses:  
3. Ports


#MAC Addresses:
- 48-bit, 6 pairs of hexadecimals joined together with a colon.
- First 24-bits identify the manufacturer who created the NIC that the MAC is assigned to. Second set of 24-bits identify the device itself.
- Data is sent as frames between devices on a LAN using MAC addresses and switch forwarding.
- Data is sent as frames from devices to a router using MAC addresses. A router would strip the data of the MAC and find the destination IP, repackage with a new data frame containing source MAC (its MAC) and destination MAC (the MAC of the router it's going to) as a hop. The new router would strip the data of the MAC, find the IP of the destination and repackage with a new source and destination MAC and direct it to the correct device on the network (how data is sent using MAC across different networks)

#IP Addresses:
- Assigned to every network-connected device that relies on Internet Protocol
- Used by routers to direct data to other routers
- Can be static or dynamic
- IPV4 is 32-bit and IPV6 is 128-bit, designed due to shortage of available IPs

= ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is often used to map MAC addresses to known IP addresses to help devices send data frames to the correct recipient. The sender would use ARP to find the MAC of the destination IP and send (with the switch seamlessly forwarding the data frame to the recipient)

#Ports:
- Different services on a device are assigned unique ports
- Often used for interacting with a device for multiple services to sort network traffic for different reasons. Applications/services running on different ports would "listen" and respond to requests e.g., a webpage request 
- Work with TCP and UDP at the Transport Layer of the OSI model
- Well-Known Ports are used commonly and universally, managed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). E.g., 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS, 20/21 for FTP
- Registered Ports are registered with the IANA but not as well monitored
- Dynamic/Private Ports are used for temporary services

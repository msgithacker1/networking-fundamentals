# Subnetting

## Key Concepts:

* Subnet Masks: tell devices on a network what part of an IP address is the network portion and what part is the host portion
* CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) Notation: A way of showing which part of the IP address belongs to the network portion. Example: /24 (this means the first 24 bits of the IP belong to the network portion and the last 8 bits belong to the host portion).

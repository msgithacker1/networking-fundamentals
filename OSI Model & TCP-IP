#The OSI Model dictates telecommunication and how data is exchanged across a network 

1. Application - simply provides network services. E.g., FTP, HTTP
2. Presentation - translator. Applies encryption/decryption/data formatting to ensure the receiver understands the content of the communicated data
3. Session - dictates opening/termination/management of a connection/session between 2 communicators. Communication is managed here 
4. Transport - segment, reorganises data and transmits it to the receiver and error checks
5. Network - routes data to its destination. Routers operate here
6. Data Link - the nodes between which data is transmitted using MAC addresses. Devices like switches operate at this layer
7. Physical - the actual data transmit across physical media, like Ethernet

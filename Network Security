# The 3 most fundamental aims of network security are:

1. Confidentiality: Is data secure from unauthorised users
2. Integrity: Is data accurate and reliable
3. Availability: Is data available to who it should be available to

# Firewalls monitor outgoing and incoming network traffic based on predetermined rules/warning signs to look out for threats to the network
# Can be hardware or software based or a combination of both

1. Packet Filtering Firewall: Operates at the Network and Transport layers of the OSI model. Only examines the source and destination iP of the packet, protocols used and the ports
2. Stateful Inspection Firewall: Smarter than packet filtering firewall as it understands the purpose of traffic across the firewall. Checks if a previous, legitimate connection had been made when the packet arrives etc.
3. Application Layer (or Proxy) Firewall: Operates the Application layer of the OSI model. Inspects the actual content of the data packets like the protocol used to see if it's malicious
4. Next Generation Firewall (NGFW): This firewall uses a mix of stateful inspection firewall as well as other new techniques like deep packet inspection, IDS/IPS ability

# Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): Observes traffic for malicious traffic but only alerts and doesn't take action
# Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS): Observes traffic for malicious traffic but actively blocks/stops the malicious activity as well

# They both analyse network packets based on this:

1. Signature-based detection: Matches the content against a known set of exploits to see if it's malicious
2. Anomaly-based detection: Sees if this network traffic is unusual

# Network-based IDS/IPS (NIDS/NIPS): Involves placing these systems at specific points in the network to optimise security
# Host-based IDS/IPS (HIDS/HIPS): Involves placing these systems at specific devices  and monitors traffic at that specific device



# Network-security can be optimised if:

1. Periodic pentesting takes place
2. Logs are monitored and threats dealt with
3. Clear permissions/policy outlined
4. Regular updates/upgrades are in place
5. There are multiple security layers (e.g., firewalls, IDS/IPS in place etc.)
